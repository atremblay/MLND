Even though there are schemes to reduce the search of inserting one point in a multidimensional space, I will consider the worst case scenario.

Then we need to compare every points to the one we are inserting. Fortunately we can keep the calculated distance as we go along and keep the $k$ top closest. $O(n_{samples})$ comparison are required. For a total of $O(n_{features}*n_{samples})$\n",

Prediction time is fast as it is not distance based like kNN.\n",

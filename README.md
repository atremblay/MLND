Project 1: Predicting Boston Housing Prices

Model Evaluation & Validation Project

Project Description

You want to be the best real estate agent out there. In order to compete with other agents in your area, you decide to use machine learning. You are going to use various statistical analysis tools to build the best model to predict the value of a given house. Your task is to find the best price your client can sell their house at. The best guess from a model is one that best generalizes the data.

For this assignment your client has a house with the following feature set: [11.95, 0.00, 18.100, 0, 0.6590, 5.6090, 90.00, 1.385, 24, 680.0, 20.20, 332.09, 12.13]. To get started, use the example scikit implementation. You will have to modify the code slightly to get the file up and running.

When you are done implementing the code please answer the following questions in a report with the appropriate sections provided.
